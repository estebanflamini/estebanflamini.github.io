I've been programming and using computers since I was 15 (now I'm 53).

Worked 10 years as a programmer & system administrator. Transitioned to a career as a translator; now looking to restart a professional career as a developer.

Experience with (among others): Python, SQL, Java, Basic, Perl, some C; Linux, bash, sed, grep, awk, git, etc.
