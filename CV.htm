<p><u>ABOUT MYSELF:</u><p>

<p>I'm an experienced programmer, translator and lifelong learner.</p>

<p>I've been programming computers non-stop since the age of 15 (I'm 53 as of Dec 2021).</p>

<p>After studying programming in high-school for 4 years, I worked 10 years as a programmer and system administrator (Universidad Nacional del Sur, Bahía Blanca, Argentina), then transitioned to the translation industry but continued programming as a hobby and to support my translation work. I'm looking forward to restarting a professional career in programming.</p>

<p>You can see a sample of my recent coding at <a href="https://github.com/estebanflamini/efabulor">https://github.com/estebanflamini/efabulor</a></p>

<p>I have written code in Python, SQL, Basic and VBA, Java, Perl, C, and PHP. I have some basic knowledge of Tcl, Lua, Cobol, Ruby, javascript and R.</p>

<p>I'm mostly a self-teaching person. I intend to start learning one or several of the following languages in 2022: Golang, Erlang, and Rust, as well as improving knowledge of Ruby and Python's scientific stack; I'm also curious about Lisp, Ada and PL/1.</p>
